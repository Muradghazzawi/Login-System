# Login-System

1.	Assume you already have some usernames and passwords stored in a database, textfile, etc.
2.	Assume that passwords will be stored as a plain text (no hashing has been applied to them) 
3.	For the first phase, you are supposed to implement a simple registration process that maintains the following password policies
•	Minimum Password Length: The length of password must always be checked automatically at the time of registration. All passwords must have at least eight (8) characters. 
•	Password Complexity: The password should contain a minimum of one (1) non-alphabetic character and should not contain more than two (2) consecutive repeated characters.
•	Password Expiration: Password expiration should be enforced on all accounts. The expiration period for user passwords should be set to 30 days or less, after which the user should be forced to change the password before any other work can be performed.
